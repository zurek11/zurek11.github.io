            I study at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies.

        <p>
            I am very interested in IT. My skills include programming, designing and managing databases.
            I have a job experience as a back-end developer in Scala. My hobbies include programming games, testing and playing them.
            Also, from "the real life" I enjoy traveling, hiking, gastronomy and bodybuilding.
            I am fascinated by VR technology at most, but I am open to all the experience IT can offer me.
